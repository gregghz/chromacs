This is  an attempt  at getting  chrome to behave  a little  more like
emacs by adding emacs-like shortcut keys to the browser.

Bindings that are currently implemented:
   Key   Description             
   C-v   Page down               
   M-v   Page up                 
   M-<   Jump to top of page     
   M->   Jump to bottom of page
